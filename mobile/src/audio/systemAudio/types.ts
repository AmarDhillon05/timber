// A platform-agnostic contract for capturing "whatever is currently playing"
// (system / tab audio) as the take's music track. Concrete handlers live
// alongside this file; the factory in ./index picks one based on the host OS.
//
// The lifecycle is deliberately two-phase so capture lines up with the drums:
//   arm()   — interactive, BEFORE recording: prompt the user for permission and
//             acquire the audio stream (this is the slow, user-facing step).
//   start() — non-interactive, fired at the exact moment the drum recorder
//             starts, so music and drums share a timeline.
//   stop()  — end capture and hand back the recorded file.
//   cancel()— release everything without producing a result (e.g. on unmount).
