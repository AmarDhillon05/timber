# Single-Mic Drum Recording Tuning Parameters

## Frequency Balance (EQ)

### Low-End Rumble
- **Goal:** Remove HVAC noise, handling noise, mic vibrations.
- **How:** High-pass filter (typically 40–80 Hz).

### Kick Presence
- **Goal:** Make kick feel fuller and more defined.
- **How:** Boost or preserve roughly 60–120 Hz.

### Boxiness / Mud
- **Goal:** Reduce "cardboard" or "blanket-over-the-kit" sound.
- **How:** Cut roughly 200–500 Hz.

### Snare Body
- **Goal:** Add fullness without muddiness.
- **How:** Gentle boost around 150–250 Hz.

### Attack / Stick Definition
- **Goal:** Improve perceived crispness and articulation.
- **How:** Boost around 2–6 kHz.

### Harshness
- **Goal:** Tame painful cymbals or phone-mic brittleness.
- **How:** Cut around 4–8 kHz when excessive.

### Air / Openness
- **Goal:** Make recording sound more spacious and less dull.
- **How:** High-shelf boost around 8–15 kHz.

## Dynamics

### Overall Dynamic Range
- **Goal:** Make quiet and loud hits feel more balanced.
- **How:** Compression (threshold, ratio, attack, release).

### Transient Strength
- **Goal:** Increase perceived punch.
- **How:** Transient shaping or slow-attack compression.

### Sustain
- **Goal:** Control how long drums ring.
- **How:** Transient shaper sustain control, gating, expansion.

### Level Consistency
- **Goal:** Avoid hits disappearing or jumping out.
- **How:** Compression, upward compression, automation.

## Room / Ambience

### Roominess
- **Goal:** Reduce excessive room reflections.
- **How:** Downward expansion, dereverberation.

### Direct-to-Room Balance
- **Goal:** Make drums feel closer to listener.
- **How:** Reduce reverberant energy between hits.

### Background Noise
- **Goal:** Remove HVAC, fans, crowd noise, hiss.
- **How:** Noise reduction, spectral denoising.

## Spectral Characteristics

### Brightness
- **Goal:** Control overall brightness.
- **How:** Spectral tilt, shelving EQ.

### Spectral Balance
- **Goal:** Prevent overly bassy or thin recordings.
- **How:** Broad-band EQ adjustments.

### Resonances
- **Goal:** Remove ringing frequencies.
- **How:** Narrow EQ cuts (notches).

## Distortion / Artifacts

### Clipping
- **Goal:** Reduce audible distortion.
- **How:** Declipping algorithms, gain reduction.

### Pumping
- **Goal:** Prevent unnatural volume breathing.
- **How:** Gentler compression settings.

### Over-Sharpening
- **Goal:** Avoid brittle, artificial highs.
- **How:** Limit high-frequency boosts and transient enhancement.

## Harmonic Content

### Warmth
- **Goal:** Add fullness and character.
- **How:** Mild tape/tube saturation.

### Presence
- **Goal:** Help drums cut through.
- **How:** Light harmonic excitation.

---

## Stereo / Spatial (if outputting stereo)

### Width
- **Goal:** Increase sense of space.
- **How:** Stereo widening or synthetic ambience.

### Depth
- **Goal:** Control perceived distance.
- **How:** Reverb and ambience manipulation.

---

## Temporal Features

### Onset Clarity
- **Goal:** Make hits easier to perceive.
- **How:** Transient enhancement, expansion.

### Ringing
- **Goal:** Control excessive decay.
- **How:** Gating, dynamic EQ.

### Timing Stability
- **Goal:** Improve groove consistency.
- **How:** Transient alignment or editing (optional).

## Perceptual Targets (High-Level Objectives)

### Punch
- Increase transient strength
- Preserve low-end attack
- Reduce masking

### Crispness
- Enhance attack frequencies
