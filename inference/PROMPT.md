# CLAP Blanket Prompts

These are the canonical zero-shot prompts the **CLAP** backend scores each audio
file against. CLAP is contrastive (audio↔text): for every blanket term it
measures how similar the audio is to that term's prompt, and the similarity
becomes the suggested `amount`. Phrase each prompt as *the condition the term
corrects or adds* — i.e. describe what the audio sounds like when you'd want
that treatment dialed up.

Format: one `term: prompt` per line. The term must match a blanket term in
`functions/blanket.py` / `inference/inference.py`. Headings and blank lines are
ignored. The frontend can layer extra context on top of these at request time
(appended to every prompt) without editing this file.
